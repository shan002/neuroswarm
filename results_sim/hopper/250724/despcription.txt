implemented ternary fov sensor and smart runner with fov half slit kept v = 0.276 and w = 0.602 for hunter agents and keeping runner velocity constant/varied at 0.276

for 2000 cycles and 500 epochs of 5 batches.


1. run more trainings with different seeds with constant runner speed6  --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp.slurm --> ready

2. run more trainings with (VS) varied speed of the runner --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp_2.slurm -->  ready

3. run more trainings with the option detect = success option off (DNS) and constant runner speed --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp_3.slurm --> ready

4. run more trainings with the option detect = success option off (DNS) and (VS) varied runner speed --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp_4.slurm --> ready

5. run more trainings with the option detect = partial credit (DPC) and constant runner speed --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp_5.slurm --> ready

6. run more trainings with the option detect = partial credit (DPC) and (VS) varied runner speed --> hunter_vs_runner_n_6_wtp_6.slurm --> ready
